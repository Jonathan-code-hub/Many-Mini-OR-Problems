        "Problem 21: Monroe County is trying to determine where to place the county fire station. The locations of the county's four major towns are given in Figure 31. Town 1 is at ( 10,20 ); town 2 is at $(60,20)$; town 3 is at $(40,30)$; town 4 is at ( 80 , 60 ). Town 1 averages 20 fires per year; town 2, 30 fires; town 3, 40 fires; and town 4, 25 fires. The county wants to build the fire station in a location that minimizes the average distance that a fire engine must travel to respond to a fire. Since most roads run in either an east-west or a north-south direction, we assume that the fire engine can only do the same. Thus, if the fire station were located at $(30,40)$ and a fire occurred at town 4 , the fire engine would have to $\\operatorname{travel}(80-30)+(60-40)=70$ miles to the fire. Use linear programming to determine where the fire station should be located. (Hint: If the fire station is to be located at the point $(x, y)$ and there is a town at the point $(a, b)$, define variables $e, w, n, s$ (east, west, north, south) that satisfy the equations $x-a=w-e$ and $y-b=n-s$. It should now be easy to obtain the correct LP formulation.)"
